Endangered?

Endangered? is a cross-platform application where users can upload an image of an animal and receive the name and conservation status of the animal.

Instructions to Run
Run npm-install on your machine and pip install all python dependencies listed in query.py. 
Also run the following two lines on the command line:

expo install expo-permissions expo-constants expo-image-picker
yarn add @react-native-community/async-storage @tensorflow/tfjs @tensorflow/tfjs-react-native expo-gl @tensorflow-models/mobilenet jpeg-js

After the installations, run "python query.py" and then run "yarn web" to spin up the web application.
The web app is built and run on expo, due to its use of React Native as the main library.
